King Th√©oden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, Steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor&#039;s family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of Kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don&#039;t know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring&#039;s power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle-earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.', 2003, 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5X-hFf6Bwo'),

Nevertheless, is the malevolent bright-eyed demon, indeed, the nightmarish creature that horrifies Derry? Either way, the otherworldly entity needs to feed, and the young team of defenders are no match for him. Do they have what it takes to face IT?', 2017, 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAUTdjf9rko');

The rest is merely so-so by Hollywood standards, but at least it\'s inoffensive and fast-paced, so there\'s little to dislike. Just not too much to love either.\r\n\r\nCompared to the original JUMANJI, this one has been updated a little to the video game era, and I did like the old nod to Atari. The plotting is one of the worst things about this, with a generic, barely-glimpsed villain and random action scenes utilising barely-impressive CGI animal effects. Of the cast, Kevin Hart is quite funny, but I found Jack Black bland and Karen Gillan to be completely out of her depth; the obvious doubling in every one of her fight scenes also gets to be a little much.', 2, 5),
